couchquery
==========

Python library for simple and dynamic access to CouchDB

Further document on this library can be obtained [hier](http://mikeal.github.io/couchquery/)

Motivation
==========
This library is created by @mikeal and I have been using it for a while. On and off I ran into some trouble and I fixed
some bug from my end. But mikeal is not maintaining it anymore.

There are many forks out there and I gather all the latest code here.

Getting Started
===============
You will need [CouchDB](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/source.html)
